 ## Why it is done and who they assist??
 The main purpose of EDA is to help look at data before making any assumptions. It can help identify obvious errors, as well as better understand patterns within the data, detect outliers or anomalous events, find interesting relations among the variables.EDA assists Data science professionals in various ways:- 1.Getting a better understanding of data     2. Visualizing the missing values 3. Asking Analytical Questions and Visualization and lots more.
